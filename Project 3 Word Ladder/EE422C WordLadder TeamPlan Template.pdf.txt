EE422C Project 3 (Word Ladder) Test Plan (Replace <...> with your actual data.)  <Student EID> <Student Name> <Student EID>Fall 2016 Test plan summary?What was your goal, methodology, and conclusion? 1 paragraph. Example: Goal of Project 3 Word Ladder was to implement both a Breadth First Search, and a Depth First Search. In implementing a methodology for creating the routines, we were mainly concerned with time complexity and ease of the algorithm. In creating a method for the solution of the program, we used pseudocode, as well as chalkboard discussions and best to worst case scenarios of BFS and DFS algorithms. In conclusion, we were able to implement a BFS and DFS routine that both ran respectively on average 100ms. Both used debugging routines in order to find bugs in our implementation, and shared screens in order to conduct the debugging discussion. Did you use JUNIT? Did you test modules or the whole thing all at once? What areas did you feel you covered in your final test suite? What did you not cover? In testing our program, we conducted both test modules and the whole program. In our final test suite, we feel we covered all best to worst case scenarios, as well as individual testing of DFS and BFS functions, and overall testing of the two functions and subsequent word ladder printing functions. . a) ÊTest name (SHORT_DFS) ?. b) ÊWhat feature does the test cover Ð 1-2 phrases or sentences. ?Test for base case of DFS routine (no more than one word in between rung). ?. c) ÊSet up for the test Ð initialization. ?Input of two known words. ?. d) ÊExpected output for a good module. ?Ladder between XXX and YYY. Single word in between rungs (only differing by a letter between the two). ?. e) ÊThe pass/fail criterion for the test.  Ladder correct.. f) ÊAny comments, if any. ?Test is expected to run in 50ms or less. ?2. . a) ÊTest name : (Long_Ladder DFS). b) ÊWhat feature does the test cover Ð 1-2 phrases or sentences. Sets a long version to check for errors, recursion errors, repeat words. ?. c) ÊSet up for the test Ð initialization. Two words with known long rungs. ?. d) ÊExpected output for a good module. Around 100ms. ?. e) ÊThe pass/fail criterion for the test. ?Correct output of the program. . f) ÊAny comments, if any. ?3. 1. Test name: (Print Ladder DFS)
